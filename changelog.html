<span class="time">5/15/2023 1684130400000</span>: Development on VOTV map started (slowly)<br><br>

<span class="time">5/18/2023 1684440018046</span>: VOTV map became public on github.io<br><br>

<span class="time">5/18/2023 1684453321842</span>: Some updates to introduce touchscreen functionality and to better accommodate small sized screens.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/19/2023 1684562278630</span>: (Hopefully) An improvement to the map panning system, which should also fix some bugs with mobile/touchscreen.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/20/2023 1684568020687</span>: Small css tweak and added some functionality to the changelog.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/20/2023 1684577875713</span>: Added points for the green, red, and blue argemia plushies and the unknown rozital technology<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684654285561</span>: Added points for the glowing blue, cyan, and magenta plushes and the antibreather plushie. Also added points for all 21 chicken burgers, but they'll be disabled until I add a system to more easily navigate the map's points.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684703990099</span>: Somehow messed up the name of the antibreather plush, and didn't attach images to it either. Don't know how I did that. In other news, a canvas is coming soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684713991486</span>: A canvas has been added! Additionally, the lines for the outer fence and the stonehenge fence have been added too. An icon for the shovel has also been added.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684719779874</span>: Touchscreen bug found and fixed. Made the information pane flicker whenever a point was clicked on.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/22/2023 1684746455772</span>: Added a bunch of points to the map.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/28/2023 1685257100333</span>: Added a point for the green locker and added a little additonal functionality to the line-drawing function. Most importantly, added the "Points" tab where you can browse and disable/enable certain points on the map. I honestly don't know how relaiable this is.<br><br>

<span class="time">7/26/2023 1685257100333</span>: I've procrastinated for a while and now two updates have been added to the game. Time to fix that, eh? Migrated this website to separate repository because I didn't understand how github pages works. 

Features/bugs to add/fix:<br>
 > Add a favicon?<br>
 > Map scaling; Map zoom in & out with pinching or scrolling<br>

 > Add a marker for the green locker (DONE)<br>
 > Investigate the monoliths and mark their locations<br>
 > A tab in the information pane to allow browsing and hiding/showing of individual types of points and locating of those points (DONE)<br>
 > when contained points are all set to hidden or shown manually, display the change on the button<br>
 > when contained points are a mixture of hidden and shown, display '[/]' with a slight gray<br>
 > when a [/] is clicked, hide all<br>
 > Indicator (highlight the point?) to show when a point is selected.<br>
 > Select points from the points tab<br>
 > Add next and previous buttons on the image preview (to accommodate touch screen users)<br>

 > Locations of papers<br>
