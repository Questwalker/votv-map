<span class="time">1684130400000</span>: Development on VOTV map started

<span class="time">1684440018046</span>: VOTV map became public on github.io

<span class="time">1684453321842</span>: Some updates to introduce touchscreen functionality and to better accommodate small sized screens.

<span class="time">1684562278630</span>: An improvement to the map panning system, which should also fix some bugs with mobile/touchscreen.

<span class="time">1684568020687</span>: Small css tweak and added some functionality to the changelog.

<span class="time">1684577875713</span>: Added points for the green, red, and blue argemia plushies and the unknown rozital technology

<span class="time">1684654285561</span>: Added points for the glowing blue, cyan, and magenta plushes and the antibreather plushie. Also added points for all 21 chicken burgers, but they'll be disabled until I add a system to more easily navigate the map's points.

<span class="time">1684703990099</span>: Fixed a mistake with the name of the antibreather plush and its images. A canvas on top of the map is coming soon.

<span class="time">1684713991486</span>: A canvas has been added! Additionally, the lines for the outer fence and the stonehenge fence have been added too. An icon for the shovel has also been added.

<span class="time">1684719779874</span>: Touchscreen bug found and fixed. Made the information pane flicker whenever a point was clicked on.

<span class="time">1684746455772</span>: Added a bunch of points to the map.

<span class="time">1685257100333</span>: Added a point for the green locker and added a little additional functionality to the line-drawing function. Most importantly, added the "Points" tab where you can browse and disable/enable certain points on the map. I honestly don't know how reliable this is.

<span class="time">1690396296876</span>: Migrated this website to separate repository to make GitHub cleaner. Some messes still exist but will be fixed soon. Added and updated a README.

<span class="time">1690937005250</span>: Many changes:
- Updated the images and information for Metal Tile #5
- Updated the images, icon, and information for the EMF Detector
- Added the fence that is the in northeast corner of the map
- Updated the box of bones image
- Updated the images and information for Metal Tile #6
- 2 shovels have been added to the map
- stonehenge shovel image has been updated
- radioactive capsule images updated
- changed rozital image
- Added the transformers and the power lines to the map
Unfortunately, some things could not be checked since this update has broken digging somewhat. (Things not appearing when dug up)

<span class="time">1691873611402</span>: Added some icons, added meta to page.

<span class="time">1692472159806</span>: Map re-centers itself when browser zooms in and out.

<span class="time">1693347631000</span>: Added numbers to the transformer icons and added lines for the bridges. Also added a sheet with various different letters to the github. Horizontal line. Working on revamping the current movement code.

<span class="time">1702849239333</span>: Halloween pumpkins added and transformer descriptions updated. Separated the point and line data from the main script for organization. Made the map a little easier to move. Some improvements to the code will be coming soon.

<span class="time">1709631848390</span>: Version 7.0 has come out. I feel a bit apprehensive about updating the map, because this update is still in alpha and things are subject to change, but I've decided to go ahead anyway. The images and descriptions for some of the metal tiles have been updated. I've chosen to not update some images because there wasn't enough of a difference to justify changing them (Metal tile #7 for example).

<span class="time">1709803937393</span>: A bit of work. Added:
- Updated descriptions for Metal Tile #9, Glowing Blue Argemia, Antibreather Plush, Picnic
- Updated images for Glowing Blue Argemia, Antibreather Plush
- Moved point for Antibreather Plush, readjusted point for Glowing Cyan Argemia plush
- Added points for Pickaxe, Candle Holder, Argemia Mug, Grave site, and Fishing Supplies
- Removed point for the drive next to the base (the drive actually still exists, but it cannot be dug up normally without getting out of bounds)
- Added lines for the ritual area.
- Tweaked the width required to switch ui arrangement
- Tidied up the borders around the tabs
- Created all the points and assets for the rune slabs and runes, but decided against adding them in this update, at least for now.
I added a line for the world border in the last update, but the canvas was actually too small to show it. I've tripled the canvas size now and tweaked the script and styling to work with it, but this could've introduced some bugs I haven't noticed.
Cleaning up the points UI and rewriting the point/line reference system is planned to happen next, so I'll do that if nothing else gets in my way.

<span class="time">1716344276865</span>: Cleaned up and organized various things. Split the main script into 3 different scripts (never done this before, don't know how it'll behave), and added points for the furfur ritual pieces. Some other mild changes, updates to some point descriptions, deleted some old unused files, prototyped a new points menu (not included here), and got rid of some inline event listeners in the main webpage.

<span class="time">1723602973169</span>: New updates and new changes. Added a point for the bike helmet in the southern cliffs and updated all the transformers descriptions and icons. Also removed the shovel at transformer 3 because I could not find it. I will be updating the tiles soon.

<span class="time">1723620007365</span>: Tiles are now updated.

<span class="time">1723802434641</span>: Large image cleanup and update. All image names now follow a naming standard. Drive box, fishing box, nuclear magenta & blue & cyan argemia plushies, red argemia plush, and stonehenge shovel images have ALL been updated.

<span class="time">1724107945889</span>: Multiple changes and multiple plans. A couple of commits have been made since this update to make some smaller changes.
- Updated the description and images for the bone box.
- Updated the description for TR_3 to include info about the cat bed.
- The abandoned house has been added as a point with an icon, and the description for the old shack was <i>very</i> slightly tweaked.
This map has had points for all of the chicken burgers for a while, but they were disabled since they visually polluted the map a lot. Now, I have re-added (most of) them with new descriptions and locations, and I've got them hidden by default. Note that, as of the most current update, two of the burgers have been moved to unknown locations, so there are two missing burger points on the map. I will add those new burgers to the map as soon as they are found.
* The pumpkins have not been updated for a while and I anticipate that many of them are incorrect now, so I've disabled them for now. 
* <strong>Important note:</strong> There are no definitive plans yet, but I am looking into third-party javascript libraries than will be able to show a map better than I can. I am aware that my map is currently missing many features, namely, zoom. I will most likely move to using a library (I am currently looking into Leaflet) so that I can focus better on improving other parts of the map.
I am also considering moving all image files to the webp format so that they load better and faster without taking up too much bandwidth.
* I may also look at some javascript libraries so I can make a better changelog page.
* The drive that was removed in a <a href="https://github.com/Questwalker/votv-map/commit/720f7906933033a154398f74f218ff8788ec5e89">previous commit</a> has been moved to an accessible location now, so I've restored it with a new icon and description.
* I am hoping to implement some sort of localstorage system soon, so that what points are shown and hidden is saved even when the page is reloaded. Hopefully I'll be able to expand this later on to save various settings and stuff.

<span class="time">1724118419845</span>: Re-added the Halloween pumpkins, and updated all the images for them all.

<span class="time">1725646382257</span>: The map now uses an orthographic map image! I decided to get into modding and was able to make a small mod that allowed me to take this image, and I am quite proud it went so well.
I am somewhat concerned about the visibility of some of the points. I feel like some points have gotten hard to see with the new image. However, I think that the benefits here outweigh the offsets, because I think the map has become <b><i><u>much</u></i></b> more understandable now. Nevertheless, I have done some <i>very</i> small editing to reduce some of the visual noise, especially on the lake.
I've also adjusted the images and descriptions for some points.

<span class="time">1725647282257</span>: Added a fancy link to a new feedback form (check it out <a href="https://forms.gle/3swU2hcG6GxEVFAh7">here</a>). I've been hoping to gather some feedback on what other people want from my website, which I hope this form can accomplish. I already know a couple of things, like proper zoom support, but I never hurts to see want other people want. It's completely anonymous, keeping privacy in mind. Don't be afraid to blast me in the form!

<span class="time">1725921169034</span>: I've been busy redesigning the structure of the webpage, but I wanted to quickly fix a longstanding bug that caused the points categories to act strange, especially when hiding and showing points. I've fixed it and I've also rearranged all the code in the points script. I also did a slight change to the code that hides the pumpkins and burgers, so they behave better now (I still will be replacing it with something better soon). Also, I've replaced the map image with another image that is slightly brighter.

<span class="time">1726171565957</span>: Redesign of the map has been going well, but while that has been happening, all the 21 burgers have been found. So, I've updated the map to include all 21 burgers now, including the new one near Whiskey and the moved one next to TR_2. I've also given them all pictures to help better locate where they are.

<span class="time">1730534692178</span>: Updated the new Halloween pumpkins for v0.8.1b, but one pumpkin is missing for now because I could not find it or get information on its location. I'm considering creating a dev branch on GitHub soon so that I can save my development progress on github and also I won't have to deal with merging issues due to me retroactively making edits to the main branch like I am doing right now, but thats all the news for now. Happy belated Halloween!

<span class="time">1730592735815</span>: The last pumpkin has been found, so I've added it to the map! I may need to adjust all the electric lines on the map soon, because they might've been moved in the terrain update, but that's for later.

<span class="time">1730600964070</span>: A little bit of cleaning. Some files that were unused were removed and the code was edited to remove some erroneous syntactic leftovers. The old shack and the burger and shovel located in it have been edited to match their new positions, with an all new shack icon too. I've also added a license to the project which has been missing for a while, GNU-GPLv3. Axe marker coming soon.

<span class="time">1730608622234</span>: Noticed that some image files were not following the naming convention and are now fixed. Additionally, added markers for the axe in the shack and the safe in the lake. Finally, I've edited the map image to 'soften' up the pixels in lake a little bit.

<span class="time">1732130000950</span>: Added markers for 7 of the skulls on the map. Also noticed that the radioactive capsule images were extremely old, so they've been updated. In other news, I've created a new <i>dev</i> branch on the project (<a href="https://github.com/Questwalker/votv-map/tree/dev">here</a>). On this branch, people can get a look into the map's development and can see what progress I've been making. I've also added a great list of the tools and such that I use while developing this map to the README for anyone who is interested.

<span class="time">1732693018889</span>: Zooming on the map is now available! Now with more experience in web dev, I've rewritten the entire structure of the page be simpler and better made, and the custom map implementation I wrote has been completely replaced with the Leaflet library, which has zooming capability plus a bunch more support for different features. I've removed the ability to view each of the individual points in the points tab, but I believe it wasn't important enough of a feature to cause any problems. <b>Please send any feedback you have about the website to the <a href="https://forms.gle/3swU2hcG6GxEVFAh7">form</a> so I can see it!</b> I don't know if this website will function perfectly everywhere, so please shoot a message on any platform if you experience any issues!

<span class="time">1734755660884</span>: Made some minor changes, moving just a couple tweaks over from the dev branch. Cleaned up the points data, which should lower the size a bit. Fixed a minor bug where when the credits section was shrunk too much, it would cause scrollbars to appear everywhere. Also slightly modified the description for the glowing magenta argemia plush.

<span class="time">1734993616605</span>: Added a new information pane sidebar menu thing. It's the little tab that is attached to the side of the information menu. Currently, it just has a button that allows you to collapse and expand the information sidebar by pressing the button, but I plan to add a couple more buttons in the future.

<span class="time">1737278535797</span>: A brand new settings button has appeared in the sidebar menu. To accompany this, I've added a new settings menu where I plan to add a lot of stuff, which you can get to by pressing that button. I've also overhauled the new tabbing system api, so I can do dynamically do it with as many tab systems as I want. The most important change, however, is a localstorage settings system! Now certain settings and configs will be stored in the browser, so everything you change will look the same even when you close or reload the tab. For now, I've added the marker categories to this system, so whatever you have hidden or shown will be saved even on reload.

<span class="time">1737596267475</span>: The latest update added a new shovel to the map and a watering can to each transformer.

<span class="time">1739141700748</span>: I've added the normal cyan, magenta, and yellow argemia plushes to the map, with some rudimentary directions+pics on how to get them. I've also changed the safe to be part of the "Kerfur Parts" category, and I've fixed a bug with leaflet's strange behavior that made markers not layer on top of each other properly. The images and descriptions for the roz tech and the nearby skull have also been tweaked a little. Someone has suggested allowing the user to export the map as an image so that they can be used as a poster in-game, which I think is a brilliant idea, so I'll try to add that soon if the settings work doesn't slow me down.

<span class="time">1740479801794</span>: Updated the icons for the drive box and the drive. I've also changed the icon for the omega ai module to have an image of the ai module instead of the safe. Finally, the fabled maid outfit has been added near TR_2.

<span class="time">1743982500570</span>: In a previous update, a small little system was implemented in order to allow for the saving of enabled/disabled categories. It was perfectly working, but needed an upgrade and re-write to optimize it and make it usable for storing all works of settings. Now in this update, I've implemented a whole new settings system to replace that old system. From a user's experience, it should all work the same as before, and it should work with the settings from the previous system, but will allow me to do all sorts of fancy stuff in the future. To accompany the new system, I've added two new toggleable settings in the settings menu, the grayscale map setting and the marker labels setting. Feel free to go check them out!

<span class="time">1749794594502</span>: Updated the icon for the picnic marker, and added a small drop shadow to all the markers on the site. These shadows should help with visibility, but I do not know about their impact on fps. Please report any notable preformance issues to the anonymous feedback form.

<span class="time">1757567410000</span>: Redesign of the points tab. Now, the whole button uses the button element for accessibility, and the entirety of the button itself is clickable, making it easier to toggle quickly. The buttons for each category are split into groups and grouped into columns of two, with a icon on each category. This is a great improvement over the previous menu.

<span class="time">1758309803514</span>: Forgot the changelog entry for the previous update. Updated the sidebar menu buttons to use button elements, and added a info button. Rewrote this changelog and improved the formatting.

<hr>Features/bugs to consider/fix:

> Be able to mark spoiler text, similar to discord
> Possibly add points for various event locations, like what I did with the picnic
> Links to github commits in the changelog
> Allow exporting map to an image
> Map switching; Switch between normal, topographic, snowy, etc.
