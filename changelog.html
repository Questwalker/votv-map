<a href=".">< Back to the main page</a><br><br>

<span class="time">1684130400000</span>: Development on VOTV map started (slowly)<br><br>

<span class="time">1684440018046</span>: VOTV map became public on github.io<br><br>

<span class="time">1684453321842</span>: Some updates to introduce touchscreen functionality and to better accommodate small sized screens.<br><br>

<span class="time">1684562278630</span>: (Hopefully) An improvement to the map panning system, which should also fix some bugs with mobile/touchscreen.<br><br>

<span class="time">1684568020687</span>: Small css tweak and added some functionality to the changelog.<br><br>

<span class="time">1684577875713</span>: Added points for the green, red, and blue argemia plushies and the unknown rozital technology<br><br>

<span class="time">1684654285561</span>: Added points for the glowing blue, cyan, and magenta plushes and the antibreather plushie. Also added points for all 21 chicken burgers, but they'll be disabled until I add a system to more easily navigate the map's points.<br><br>

<span class="time">1684703990099</span>: Somehow messed up the name of the antibreather plush, and didn't attach images to it either. Don't know how I did that. In other news, a canvas is coming soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">1684713991486</span>: A canvas has been added! Additionally, the lines for the outer fence and the stonehenge fence have been added too. An icon for the shovel has also been added.<br><br>

<span class="time">1684719779874</span>: Touchscreen bug found and fixed. Made the information pane flicker whenever a point was clicked on.<br><br>

<span class="time">1684746455772</span>: Added a bunch of points to the map.<br><br>

<span class="time">1685257100333</span>: Added a point for the green locker and added a little additional functionality to the line-drawing function. Most importantly, added the "Points" tab where you can browse and disable/enable certain points on the map. I honestly don't know how reliable this is.<br><br>

<span class="time">1690396296876</span>: I've procrastinated for a while and now two updates have been added to the game. Time to fix that, eh? Migrated this website to separate repository to make my github cleaner. A bit messy of a move and there are still some unfinished bits that were accidentally published. Will be fixed soon. Added and updated a README.<br><br>

<span class="time">1690937005250</span>: Massive changes:<br>
- Updated the images and information for Metal Tile #5<br>
- Updated the images, icon, and information for the EMF Detector<br>
- Added the fence that is the in northeast corner of the map<br>
- Updated the box of bones image<br>
- Updated the images and information for Metal Tile #6<br>
- 2 shovels have been added to the map<br>
- stonehenge shovel image has been updated<br>
- radioactive capsule images updated<br>
- changed rozital image<br>
- Added the transformers and the power lines to the map<br>
Unfortunately, some things could not be checked since this update has broken digging somewhat. (Things not appearing when dug up)<br>
Not 100% sure everything is fixed here, but I need to push this update out soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">1691873611402</span>: Added some icons, added meta to page.<br><br>

<span class="time">1692472159806</span>: Map re-centers itself when browser zooms in and out.<br><br>

<span class="time">1693347631000</span>: Added numbers to the transformer icons and added lines for the bridges. Also added a sheet with various different letters to the github. Horizontal line. Working on revamping the current movement code.<br><br>

<span class="time">1702849239333</span>: I'm free and its time to to update this again. Halloween pumpkins added and transformer descriptions updated. Separated the point and line data from the main script for organization. Got some ideas in the backlog and made the map a little easier to move. Some code is clean but others is messy, and I desperately need to clean up the point/line code.<br><br>

<span class="time">1709631848390</span>: The new version 7 update has come out. I feel a bit apprehensive about updating the map, because this update is still in alpha and things are subject to change, but I've decided to go ahead anyway. The images and descriptions for some of the metal tiles have been updated. I've chosen to not update some images because there wasn't enough of a difference to justify changing them (Metal tile #7 for example). I've also removed the old-assets folder from the project because it was just taking up space. More updates are to come.<br><br>

<span class="time">1709803937393</span>: A little bit of work. Added:<br>
- Updated descriptions for Metal Tile #9, Glowing Blue Argemia, Antibreather Plush, Picnic<br>
- Updated images for Glowing Blue Argemia, Antibreather Plush<br>
- Moved point for Antibreather Plush, readjusted point for Glowing Cyan Argemia plush<br>
- Added points for Pickaxe, Candle Holder, Argemia Mug, Grave site, and Fishing Supplies<br>
- Removed point for the drive next to the base (the drive actually still exists, but it cannot be dug up normally without getting out of bounds)<br>
- Added lines for the ritual area.<br>
- Tweaked the width required to switch ui arrangement<br>
- Tidied up the borders around the tabs<br>
- Created all the points and assets for the rune slabs and runes, but decided against adding them in this update, at least for now.<br>
I added a line for the world border in the last update, but the canvas was actually too small to show it. I've tripled the canvas size now and tweaked the script and styling to work with it, but this could've introduced some bugs I haven't noticed.<br>
Next up, I really want to work on cleaning up the points UI and rewriting the point/line reference system, so I'll do that if nothing else gets in my way.<br><br>

<span class="time">1716344276865</span>: Cleaned up and organized some things. Split the main script into 3 different scripts (never done this before, don't know how it'll behave), and added points for the furfur ritual pieces. Some other mild changes, updates to some point descriptions, deleted some old unused files, prototyped a new points menu (not included here), and got rid of some inline event listeners in the main webpage.<br><br>

<span class="time">1723602973169</span>: New updates and new changes. Added a point for the bike helmet in the southern cliffs and updated all the transformers descriptions and icons. Also removed the shovel at transformer 3 because I could not find it. I will be updating the tiles soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">1723620007365</span>: Tiles are updated!<br><br>

<span class="time">1723802434641</span>: Massive image cleanup and update. All image names now follow a standard and aren't just named randomly. Drive box, fishing box, nuclear magenta & blue & cyan argemia plushies, red argemia plush, and stonehenge shovel images have ALL been updated.<br><br>

<span class="time">1724107945889</span>: Lots of changes and a lot of aspirations. A couple of commits have been made since this update to make some smaller changes.<br>
- Updated the description and images for the bone box.<br>
- Updated the description for TR_3 to include info about the cat bed.<br>
- The abandoned house has been added as a point with an icon, and the description for the old shack was <i>very</i> slightly tweaked.<br>
This map has had points for all of the chicken burgers for a while now, but they were disabled since they visually polluted the map a lot and I didn't have much of a solution to fix that back then. Now, I have re-added (most) of the chicken burgers with their new descriptions and locations, and I've got them hidden by default using the same method I did with the pumpkins. On the flip side, the pumpkins have not been updated for a while and I anticipate that many of them are incorrect now, so I've disabled them for now. Note that, as of the most current update, two of the burgers have been moved to unknown locations, so there are two missing burger points on the map. I will add those new burgers to the map as soon as they are found.<br>
Now for another important message: There are no definitive plans yet, but I am looking into third-party javascript libraries than will be able to show a map better than I can. I am aware that my map is currently missing many features, namely, zoom. I have mostly been avoiding trying to improve my map (because javascript is horrible and terrifying), and I know that has been inconveniencing my users, so I will most likely move to using a library (I am currently looking into Leaflet.js) so that I can focus better on improving other parts of the map.<br>
I am also contemplating moving all image files to the webp format so that they load better and faster without taking up too much bandwidth.<br>
Also, side note, but the drive that was removed in commit <a href="https://github.com/Questwalker/votv-map/commit/720f7906933033a154398f74f218ff8788ec5e89">720f790</a> has been moved to an accessible location now, so I've restored it with a new icon and description!<br>
Also also, I might look at some javascript libraries so I can make a better changelog page too.<br>
Also also <i>also</i>, I am hoping to implement some sort of localstorage system soon, so that what points are shown and hidden is saved even when the page is reloaded. Hopefully I'll be able to expand this later on to save various settings and stuff.<br><br>

<span class="time">1724118419845</span>: Re-added the Halloween pumpkins, and updated all the images for them all.<br><br>

<span class="time">1725646382257</span>: Behold! A orthographic map image! I decided to get into Unreal modding and was able to make a small mod that can toggle the camera between orthographic and perspective, change the "zoom" with some hotkeys + modifiers, and can center and rotate the camera with a few other hotkeys. This was my first time ever modding and my first time ever using the Unreal Engine, so I am quite proud it went so well.<br>
I am somewhat concerned about the visibility of some of the points. I feel like some points have gotten hard to see with the new image. However, I think that the benefits here outweigh the offsets, because I think the map has become <b><i><u>much</u></i></b> more understandable now. Nevertheless, I have done some <i>very</i> small editing to reduce some of the visual noise, especially on the lake.<br>
I've also adjusted the images and descriptions for some points.<br><br>

<span class="time">1725647282257</span>: Added a fancy link to a new feedback form I made (check it out <a href="https://forms.gle/3swU2hcG6GxEVFAh7">here</a>). I've been hoping to gather some feedback on what other people want from my website. I already know a couple of things, like proper zoom support, but I never hurts to see want other people want. It's completely anonymous, so I won't know who you are and you can submit it even without a google account. If you're reading this, don't be afraid to blast me in the form, don't hold back!<br><br>

<span class="time">1725921169034</span>: I've been busy redesigning the structure of the webpage, but I wanted to quickly fix a longstanding bug that caused the points categories to act strange, especially when hiding and showing points. Apparently the bug was caused because the specific piece of code designed to handle hiding/showing was commented out for some reason. I've uncommented it out and I've also rearranged all the code in the points script. I also did a slight change to the code that hides the pumpkins and burgers, so they behave better now (I still will be replacing it with something better soon). Also, I've replaced the map image with another image that is slightly brighter.<br><br>

<span class="time">1726171565957</span>: Redesign of the map has been going well, but while that has been happening, all the 21 burgers have been found. So, I've updated the map to include all 21 burgers now, including the new one near Whiskey and the moved one next to TR_2. I've also given them all pictures to help better locate where they are.<br><br>

<span class="time">1730534692178</span>: Updated the new Halloween pumpkins for v0.8.1b. Currently the map is missing one pumpkin because I could not find it or get information on it's location. In other news, I'm considering creating a dev branch (however that works) so that I can save my development progress on github and also I won't have to deal with merging issues due to me retroactively making edits to the main branch like I am doing right now, but thats all the news for now. Happy belated Halloween!<br><br>

<span class="time">1730592735815</span>: Found the last pumpkin! I've realized that I may need to adjust all the electric lines on the map soon, because they might've been moved in the terrain update, but that's for later.<br><br>

<span class="time">1730600964070</span>: A little bit of cleaning. Some files that were unused were removed and the code was edited to remove some erroneous syntactic leftovers. The old shack and the burger and shovel located in it have been edited to match their new positions, with an all new shack icon too. I've also added a license to the project, GNU-GPLv3. I've meant to do that for a bit, but never got the chance. Axe marker coming soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">1730608622234</span>: Noticed that I incorrectly named many of the image files. Fixed now. VSCode is garbage so I had to manually rename all of the pumpkin and burger images individually with the command line. Additionally, added markers for the axe in the shack and the safe in the lake. Finally, I've edited the map image to 'soften' up the pixels in lake a little bit. Now it looks a little easier to look at.<br><br>

<span class="time">1732130000950</span>: Added markers for 7 of the skulls on the map. While I was at it, I noticed that the radioactive capsule images were extremely old, so I've updated them. In other news, I've created a new <i>dev</i> branch on the project (<a href="https://github.com/Questwalker/votv-map/tree/dev">here</a>). I've created it so people can have a look into the map's development and can see what progress I've been making. I've also added a cool list of tools and such that I use while developing this map to the README, so you can see what I like to use.<br><br>

<span class="time">1732693018889</span>: After way too long of a time, zooming is now available. The structure of the entire page has been rewritten to be simpler and better made, and the map functionality (which was previously written completely by me) has been replaced with the Leaflet library, which has zooming capability plus a bunch more support for different features. The only notable feature that has changed except that is I've removed the ability to view each of the individual points in the points tab, but I hope it wasn't important enough of a feature to cause any problems. <b>Please send any feedback you have about the website to the <a href="https://forms.gle/3swU2hcG6GxEVFAh7">form</a> so I can see it!</b> I don't know if this website will function perfectly everywhere, so please shoot a message on any platform if you experience any issues!<br><br>

<span class="time">1734755660884</span>: Made some minor changes, moving just a couple tweaks over from the dev branch. Cleaned up the points data, which should lower the size a bit. Fixed a minor bug where when the credits section was shrunk too much, it would cause scrollbars to appear everywhere. Also slightly modified the description for the glowing magenta argemia plush.<br><br>

<span class="time">1734993616605</span>: Added a new information pane sidebar menu thing. It's the little tab that is "attached" to the information menu. Currently, I've just added a little button that allows you to collapse and expand the information sidebar by pressing the button, but I plan to add a couple more buttons in the future (If you actually check the dev branch, you'll see I've already added a settings button). When I do that, I plan to move the current credits and contacts into a submenu accessed through that menu, so that they aren't always taking up space when using the website normally.<br><br>

<span class="time">1737278535797</span>: A brand new settings button has appeared in the sidebar menu. To accompany this, I've added a new settings menu where I plan to add a lot of stuff, which you can get to by pressing that button. I've overhauled the new tabbing system api, so I can do dynamically do it with as many tab systems as I want. The biggest change, however, is the new localstorage system! Now, certain settings and configs will be stored in the browser, so everything you change will look the same even when you close or reload the tab. For now, I've added the different map layers to this system, so whatever you have hidden or shown will be saved even on reload.<br><br>

<span class="time">1737596267475</span>: The latest update added a new shovel to the map and a watering can to each transformer.
