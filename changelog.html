<a href=".">< Back to the main page</a><br><br>

<span class="time">5/15/2023 1684130400000</span>: Development on VOTV map started (slowly)<br><br>

<span class="time">5/18/2023 1684440018046</span>: VOTV map became public on github.io<br><br>

<span class="time">5/18/2023 1684453321842</span>: Some updates to introduce touchscreen functionality and to better accommodate small sized screens.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/19/2023 1684562278630</span>: (Hopefully) An improvement to the map panning system, which should also fix some bugs with mobile/touchscreen.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/20/2023 1684568020687</span>: Small css tweak and added some functionality to the changelog.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/20/2023 1684577875713</span>: Added points for the green, red, and blue argemia plushies and the unknown rozital technology<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684654285561</span>: Added points for the glowing blue, cyan, and magenta plushes and the antibreather plushie. Also added points for all 21 chicken burgers, but they'll be disabled until I add a system to more easily navigate the map's points.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684703990099</span>: Somehow messed up the name of the antibreather plush, and didn't attach images to it either. Don't know how I did that. In other news, a canvas is coming soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684713991486</span>: A canvas has been added! Additionally, the lines for the outer fence and the stonehenge fence have been added too. An icon for the shovel has also been added.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684719779874</span>: Touchscreen bug found and fixed. Made the information pane flicker whenever a point was clicked on.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/22/2023 1684746455772</span>: Added a bunch of points to the map.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/28/2023 1685257100333</span>: Added a point for the green locker and added a little additional functionality to the line-drawing function. Most importantly, added the "Points" tab where you can browse and disable/enable certain points on the map. I honestly don't know how reliable this is.<br><br>

<span class="time">7/26/2023 1690396296876</span>: I've procrastinated for a while and now two updates have been added to the game. Time to fix that, eh? Migrated this website to separate repository to make my github cleaner. A bit messy of a move and there are still some unfinished bits that were accidentally published. Will be fixed soon. Added and updated a README.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/1/2023 1690937005250</span>: Massive changes:<br>
- Updated the images and information for Metal Tile #5<br>
- Updated the images, icon, and information for the EMF Detector<br>
- Added the fence that is the in northeast corner of the map<br>
- Updated the box of bones image<br>
- Updated the images and information for Metal Tile #6<br>
- 2 shovels have been added to the map<br>
- stonehenge shovel image has been updated<br>
- radioactive capsule images updated<br>
- changed rozital image<br>
- Added the transformers and the power lines to the map<br>
Unfortunately, some things could not be checked since this update has broken digging somewhat. (Things not appearing when dug up)<br>
Not 100% sure everything is fixed here, but I need to push this update out soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/16/2023 1691873611402</span>: Added some icons, added meta to page.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/19/2023 1692472159806</span>: Map re-centers itself when browser zooms in and out.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/29/2023 1693347631000</span>: Added numbers to the transformer icons and added lines for the bridges. Also added a sheet with various different letters to the github. Horizontal line. Working on revamping the current movement code.<br><br>

<span class="time">12/17/2023 1702849239333</span>: I'm free and its time to to update this again. Halloween pumpkins added and transformer descriptions updated. Separated the point and line data from the main script for organization. Got some ideas in the backlog and made the map a little easier to move. Some code is clean but others is messy, and I desperately need to clean up the point/line code.<br><br>

<span class="time">3/5/2024 1709631848390</span>: The new version 7 update has come out. I feel a bit apprehensive about updating the map, because this update is still in alpha and things are subject to change, but I've decided to go ahead anyway. The images and descriptions for some of the metal tiles have been updated. I've chosen to not update some images because there wasn't enough of a difference to justify changing them (Metal tile #7 for example). I've also removed the old-assets folder from the project because it was just taking up space. More updates are to come.<br><br>

<span class="time">3/7/2024 1709803937393</span>: A little bit of work. Added:<br>
- Updated descriptions for Metal Tile #9, Glowing Blue Argemia, Antibreather Plush, Picnic<br>
- Updated images for Glowing Blue Argemia, Antibreather Plush<br>
- Moved point for Antibreather Plush, readjusted point for Glowing Cyan Argemia plush<br>
- Added points for Pickaxe, Candle Holder, Argemia Mug, Gravesite, and Fishing Supplies<br>
- Removed point for the drive next to the base (the drive actually still exists, but it cannot be dug up normally without getting out of bounds)<br>
- Added lines for the ritual area.<br>
- Tweaked the width required to switch ui arrangement<br>
- Tidied up the borders around the tabs<br>
- Created all the points and assets for the rune slabs and runes, but decided against adding them in this update, at least for now.<br>
I added a line for the world border in the last update, but the canvas was actually too small to show it. I've tripled the canvas size now and tweaked the script and styling to work with it, but this could've introduced some bugs I haven't noticed.<br>
Next up, I really want to work on cleaning up the points UI and rewriting the point/line reference system, so I'll do that if nothing else gets in my way.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2024 1716344276865</span>: Cleaned up and organized some things. Split the main script into 3 different scripts (never done this before, don't know how it'll behave), and added points for the furfur ritual pieces. Some other mild changes, updates to some point descriptions, deleted some old unused files, prototyped a new points menu (not included here), and got rid of some inline event listeners in the main webpage.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/13/2024 1723602973169</span>: New updates and new changes. Added a point for the bike helmet in the southern cliffs and updated all the transformers descriptions and icons. Also removed the shovel at transformer 3 because I could not find it. I will be updating the tiles soon.<br><br>
