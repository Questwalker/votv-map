<span class="time">5/15/2023 1684130400000</span>: Development on VOTV map started (slowly)<br><br>

<span class="time">5/18/2023 1684440018046</span>: VOTV map became public on github.io<br><br>

<span class="time">5/18/2023 1684453321842</span>: Some updates to introduce touchscreen functionality and to better accommodate small sized screens.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/19/2023 1684562278630</span>: (Hopefully) An improvement to the map panning system, which should also fix some bugs with mobile/touchscreen.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/20/2023 1684568020687</span>: Small css tweak and added some functionality to the changelog.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/20/2023 1684577875713</span>: Added points for the green, red, and blue argemia plushies and the unknown rozital technology<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684654285561</span>: Added points for the glowing blue, cyan, and magenta plushes and the antibreather plushie. Also added points for all 21 chicken burgers, but they'll be disabled until I add a system to more easily navigate the map's points.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684703990099</span>: Somehow messed up the name of the antibreather plush, and didn't attach images to it either. Don't know how I did that. In other news, a canvas is coming soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684713991486</span>: A canvas has been added! Additionally, the lines for the outer fence and the stonehenge fence have been added too. An icon for the shovel has also been added.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684719779874</span>: Touchscreen bug found and fixed. Made the information pane flicker whenever a point was clicked on.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/22/2023 1684746455772</span>: Added a bunch of points to the map.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/28/2023 1685257100333</span>: Added a point for the green locker and added a little additional functionality to the line-drawing function. Most importantly, added the "Points" tab where you can browse and disable/enable certain points on the map. I honestly don't know how reliable this is.<br><br>

<span class="time">7/26/2023 1690396296876</span>: I've procrastinated for a while and now two updates have been added to the game. Time to fix that, eh? Migrated this website to separate repository to make my github cleaner. A bit messy of a move and there are still some unfinished bits that were accidentally published. Will be fixed soon. Added and updated a README.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/1/2023 1690937005250</span>: Massive changes:<br>
 - Updated the images and information for Metal Tile #5<br>
 - Updated the images, icon, and information for the EMF Detector<br>
 - Added the fence that is the in northeast corner of the map<br>
 - Updated the box of bones image<br>
 - Updated the images and information for Metal Tile #6<br>
 - 2 shovels have been added to the map<br>
 - stonehenge shovel image has been updated<br>
 - radioactive capsule images updated<br>
 - changed rozital image<br>
 - Added the transformers and the power lines to the map<br>
Unfortunately, some things could not be checked since this update has broken digging somewhat. (Things not appearing when dug up)<br>
Not 100% sure everything is fixed here, but I need to push this update out soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/16/2023 1691873611402</span>: Added some icons, added meta to page.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/19/2023 1692472159806</span>: Map re-centers itself when browser zooms in and out.<br><br>

<span class="time">8/29/2023 1693347631000</span>: Added numbers to the tranformer icons and added lines for the bridges. Also added a sheet with various different letters to the github. Horizontal line. Working on revamping the current movement code.<br><br>

<span class="time">12/17/2023 1702849239333</span>: I'm free and its time to to update this again. Halloween pumpkins added and transformer descriptions updated. Separated the point and line data from the main script for organization. Got some ideas in the backlog and made the map a little easier to move. Some code is clean but others is messy, and I desperately need to clean up the point/line code.<br><br>

<span class="time">3/5/2024 1709631848390</span>: The new version 7 update has come out. I feel a bit apprehensive about updating the map, because this update is still in alpha and things are subject to change, but I've decided to go ahead anyway. The images and descriptions for some of the metal tiles have been updated. I've chosen to not update some images because there wasn't enough of a difference to justify changing them (Metal tile #7 for example). I've also removed the old-assets folder from the project because it was just taking up space. More updates are to come.

Features/bugs to add/fix:<br>
 > Add a favicon?<br>
 > Map scaling; Map zoom in & out with pinching or scrolling<br>
 > Somehow get a orthographic picture of the map to use instead of the current grayscale one.<br>
 > Investigate the monoliths and mark their locations<br>
 > when contained points are all set to hidden or shown manually, display the change on the button<br>
 > when contained points are a mixture of hidden and shown, display '[/]' with a slight gray<br>
 > when a [/] is clicked, hide all<br>
 > Indicator (highlight the point?) to show when a point is selected.<br>
 > Select points from the points tab<br>
 > Add next and previous buttons on the image preview (to accommodate touch screen users)<br>
 > A small field where a user can input their own coordinates and get a marker on the map of where they are<br>
 > Locations of papers<br>
 > Show what category the point is in in the information tab.<br>
 > Little tab placed above points when you click on them.<br>
 > Points in the points tab should be clickable. Clicking them should open the information tab and show the indicator tab above the point.<br>
 > A selected point should have its z-index changed so it lays on top of all other points<br>
 > Be able to mark spoiler text, similar to discord<br>
 > I could add points for various event locations, like what I did with the picnic<br>
 > <b>Major rework of points lines and references code needed.</b><br>
 > Setting to swap satelite dish names to the old ones in a settings menu?
